    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>javaScript developed by</h2>
    <p>JavaScript was developed by <mark>Brendan Eich in 1995</mark> while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. It was originally called Mocha, but was later renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a programming language that is characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is used in web development to add interactivity to web pages, create mobile apps, develop games, and more.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which are HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that allows you to manipulate objects on a web page. It is used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that scripts written in JavaScript must be processed by a web browser or server-side engine that implements the JavaScript specification.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a weakly typed language, which means that it does not require you to declare the type of variables before you use them. This makes the language flexible and easy to use.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means that objects can inherit properties directly from other objects.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports object-oriented, imperative, and declarative programming styles.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a dynamic language, which means that it can modify its behavior at runtime.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means that it can only execute one task at a time. However, it can delegate tasks to other threads using web workers.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a case-sensitive language, which means that it distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a client-side language, which means that it runs on the client side of a web application. It is used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a server-side language, which means that it runs on the server side of a web application. It is used to create dynamic web pages and web applications.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a platform-independent language, which means that it can run on any platform that has a JavaScript engine.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used to create a wide range of applications, from simple web pages to complex web applications.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a popular language that is widely used in web development. It is supported by all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a powerful language that is used to create interactive web pages, web applications, and mobile apps. It is a versatile language that can be used to create a wide range of applications.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a flexible language that is easy to learn and use. It is a popular language that is widely used in web development.</p>
